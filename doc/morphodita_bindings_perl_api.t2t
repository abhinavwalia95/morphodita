Perl MorphoDiTa Bindings
========================

%!encoding: utf-8

MorphoDiTa library is available in the ``Ufal::MorphoDiTa`` package.
The classes can be imported into the current namespace using the ``:all``
export tag.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the ``C++`` bindings API.
Vectors do not have native Perl interface, see ``Ufal::MorphoDiTa::Forms`` for
reference. Static methods and enumerations are available only through the
module, not through object instance.
