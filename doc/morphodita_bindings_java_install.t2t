To compile Java bindings, run ``make`` in the ``bindings/java`` directory,
optionally with the described Make options. Java 6 and newer is supported.

The Java installation specified in the environment variable ``JAVA_HOME`` is
used.  If the environment variable does not exist, the ``JAVA_HOME`` can be
specified using
``` make JAVA_HOME=path_to_Java_installation
