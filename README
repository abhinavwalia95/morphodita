MorphoDiTa
==========

MorphoDiTa: Morphologic Dictionary and Tagger is an open-source tool for
morphologic analysis of natural language texts. It performs tokenzation,
morphologic analysis, morphologic generation and tagging and is distributed as
a standalone tool or a library, along with trained linguistic models. In the
Czech language, MorphoDiTa achieves state-of-the-art results with a throughput
around 10-200K words per second. Compared to Featurama
http://sourceforge.net/projects/featurama/ (state-of-the-art Czech tagger
implementation), it is 5 times faster with models 10 times smaller. MorphoDiTa
is a free software under LGPL http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html license and
the linguistic models are free for non-commercial use and distributed under CC
